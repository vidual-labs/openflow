# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenFlow are documented in this file.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Animated Backgrounds** — 4 pure-CSS motion presets: Waves, Bubbles, Aurora, Geometric. Uses primary + accent color.
- **Button Position** — New theme option to place the "Next" button in the footer bar (default) or inline below the input field
- **Enter Key Hint** — Optional "press Enter ↵" hint displayed next to the Next button (toggle in Design tab)
- **Accent Color** — New color picker for the secondary color used in animated backgrounds (auto-derived if empty)
- **Font Family Picker** — Choose from popular web fonts (Inter, Space Grotesk, DM Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans, Georgia, Courier New)

### Changed
- **Design tab redesign** — Restructured with icon headers, descriptions, and visual card selectors (inspired by Typeform/Formbricks)
- Form layout uses proper flex-flow instead of fixed positioning — content centers naturally between header and nav
- Footer links now render above the navigation bar so controls are always the bottom-most row
- Progress bar uses absolute positioning (within container) instead of fixed

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- Forms with submissions, integrations, or analytics data can now be deleted (foreign key cascade)
- Dark mode no longer bleeds into public form preview — preview always uses the configured background color
- Vertical centering of form questions works correctly on all screen sizes

### Changed
- Single Choice fields now auto-advance on click (like Yes/No and Image Select)
- Removed keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, A/B/C letter keys) from selection fields — focus ring was visible and confusing
- Nav bar in form preview uses the form's configured background color

### Added
- Delete protection for published forms: requires typing the form name to confirm
